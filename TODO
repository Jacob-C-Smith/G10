TODO File, place TODOs here

=== Framework goals ===
 - ✅ Write a JSON parser to read scenes and entities from the game.
 - ✅ In the JSON parser, skip objects within objects by keeping track of how many '{' and '}' we have hit; Also, skip over strings as they may contain a '{' but not a '}', and vice versa.
 - ✅ Parse arrays in JSON parser.
 - ✅ Develop an expandable schematic for entities and scenes.
 - ✅ Use JSON parser to read entities for the game engine.
 - ✅ Use JSON parser to read scenes for the game engine.
 - ❌ Fully document the JSON parser
 - ❌ Parse rigidbody files as paths
 - ❌ Parse camera files as paths
 - ❌ Parse light files as paths
 - ❌ Parse rigidbody files as paths
 
=== Renderer goals ===
 - ✅ PBR model
 - ❌ Implement a key/value pairs system to associate scene information with uniform variables in glsl
 - ❌ Handle multiple albedo images in one material
 - ❌ Process out lights
 - ❌ Linearly assign lights
 - ❌ Implement a method that periodically reprioritizes  lights based on how far they are from a camera

=== Physics goals ===
 - ✅ Summate and apply forces on an entity
 - ✅ Calculate acceleration, velocity, and position 
 - ❌ Summate and apply torque
 - ❌ Calculate angular acceleration, velocity, and rotation
 - ❌ Collision detection, box, sphere, (cylinder???).
 - ❌ Rigidbody physics.

=== General goals ===
 - ❌ Write broader initialization functions for G10. The function should use clargs to initialize OpenGL, SDL2, and GX by passing a scene to load.
 - ❌ Implement multithreading.
 - ❌ Export this whole project into a DLL file so that other developers can use it.
 - ❌ Figure out a better way of handling input.
